## Why this project?

Fluent Vantage Toolbar is an independent replacement for the familiar Lenovo Vantage Toolbar.

I built this toolbar after Lenovo removed the original feature in favor of its widget. I kept the concept I liked: battery information and quick controls right by the taskbar. Then I brought it into the Windows 11 design language and added a little customization, with configurable quick-control tiles.

### The original inspiration: Lenovo Vantage Toolbar

Independent project, not an official Lenovo product or a replacement for the full Vantage app.

| Rapid charging | Enable rapid charging where the firmware supports it |
| Mute mic | Mute active Windows microphone capture endpoints |
| Touchpad | Toggle the supported touchpad-lock route |

Refresh rate and Always-on USB are hidden by default on fresh settings. Existing saved choices are preserved.

<details>
<summary><b>Device information</b></summary>

The **About your device** page contains scrollable cards for:

- Device identity, Windows version, BIOS and a masked serial number with a reveal button.
- Warranty dates from a cached result, with an explicit Lenovo warranty-check button.
- Platform and control availability, without guessing extra firmware features from a model name.
- CPU, GPU driver details, RAM modules and motherboard.
- Physical storage, local volumes and active display modes.
- Battery capacity, health, cycle count and manufacture date when available.
- Physical network adapters.

Unavailable hardware data is marked as such. Dedicated GPU memory is not inferred from WMI's unreliable `AdapterRAM` field.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Appearance and behavior</b></summary>

- Light, dark or system theme.
- Configurable tile visibility.
- Battery-details and warranty links can be hidden.
- Closing the flyout hides it; **Close app** exits the tray process.
- Optional elevated startup task for launching with Windows without a repeated UAC prompt.
- Custom show/hide animation, respecting Windows' animation setting.

## Compatibility

| Model | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Legion 5 15ITH6H (82JH)** | **Verified on the developer's machine** | Reference machine for live testing; support may vary with firmware and drivers. |
| Other Legion models | Expected, unverified | Each control is checked separately; other models remain unverified. |
| LOQ models | Expected, unverified | LOQ identity is recognized; firmware/control paths are not verified across the series. |
| IdeaPad / Yoga / Slim / ThinkBook | Not supported by this project | Outside the supported device family and protocol coverage. Models with `ACPI\VPC2004` can try [lenovo-battery-tray](https://github.com/sahidhh/lenovo-battery-tray); Yoga support there is expected, unverified. |
| ThinkPad | Not supported by this project | [lenovo-battery-tray](https://github.com/sahidhh/lenovo-battery-tray) also explicitly does not support ThinkPad.  |

Issue reports should include the model, machine type, Windows version and relevant error. Diagnostic logs should be reviewed for private identifiers before sharing.

## Installation

Packages are available in [**Releases**](../../releases):

| Package | Best for | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Setup-with-dotnet.exe` | Most users | Includes the required .NET runtime |
| `Setup.exe` | Users with the runtime already installed | .NET 8 Desktop Runtime, x64 |
| `portable-x64.zip` | Running without installation | Extract the entire ZIP; .NET 8 Desktop Runtime, x64 |

Windows x64 and compatible Lenovo drivers are required. Portable packages must be fully extracted before running **FluentLegionToolbar.exe**; the executable name is retained for upgrade compatibility.

The installer supports an optional elevated startup task. Settings controls language, theme and tile visibility.

## Languages

The interface offers English, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Japanese. Arabic uses right-to-left layout. Some newer device-detail text falls back to English where a translation is not yet available.

## Privacy and hardware notes

- Device inventory is read locally. The serial starts masked.
- Clicking **Check warranty with Lenovo** sends the device's serial number and machine type to Lenovo. Opening the device page alone does not perform that network request.
- Fn Lock starts ON in the UI by design. Startup does not write Fn Lock to the firmware.
- Unsupported or unreadable controls remain unavailable.
- Competing hardware-control tools may interfere with each other.
